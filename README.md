    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Compute the [greatest common divisor][gcd] (gcd).

<!-- Section to include introductory text. Make sure to keep an empty line after the intro `section` element and another before the `/section` close. -->

<section class="intro">

The [greatest common divisor][gcd] (gcd) of two non-zero integers `a` and `b` is the largest positive integer which divides both `a` and `b` without a remainder. The gcd is also known as the **greatest common factor** (gcf), **highest common factor** (hcf), **highest common divisor**, and **greatest common measure** (gcm).

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import gcd from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-gcd@v0.3.2-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### gcd( a, b )

Computes the [greatest common divisor][gcd] (gcd).

```javascript
var v = gcd( 48, 18 );
// returns 6
```

If both `a` and `b` are `0`, the function returns `0`.

```javascript
var v = gcd( 0, 0 );
// returns 0
```

Both `a` and `b` must have integer values; otherwise, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var v = gcd( 3.14, 18 );
// returns NaN

v = gcd( 48, 3.14 );
// returns NaN

v = gcd( NaN, 18 );
// returns NaN

v = gcd( 48, NaN );
// returns NaN
```
